# Greengrass ModBus Protocol Conversion

This is a codified version of AWS blog [Perform Protocol Conversion at the Edge with AWS Lambda and AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/perform-protocol-conversion-at-the-edge-with-aws-lambda-and-aws-greengrass/).

The Greengrass setup is defined as YAML in [`greengo.yaml`](./greengo.yaml) and deployed programmatically via AWS API. This way surely beats clicking through 19 screens on AWS console, and starting all over because you might fat-fingered something mid way.
